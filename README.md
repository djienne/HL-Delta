FORKED VERSION with 
* added coins (SOL, PUMP, FARTCOIN, ...), will probably add more later.
* uses wallet address instead of Vault (no need to pay 100$ to set up a Vault).
* Added leverage parameter that will change the leverage (3 by default) and put margin to Cross (**always use a dedicated account for this bot**).
* The script `show_tickers.py` shows all tickers for futures and spot, to help to code them in Delta.py (eg. for FARTCOIN, spot name is UFART and futures name is FARTCOIN; it is somewhat arbitrary so it will be hardcoded).

Additional information:
*  Use a dedicated hot wallet. Make sure Leverage is set to Cross. You may set it to 3, or a lower value depending in your `spot_pct` and `perp_pct`. Be careful.
*  in `config.json`, the BASE string of the Futures Market should be used; format of market are is BASE/USDC:USDC (use only BASE).
*  You should use a dedicated Hot Wallet. Cold wallets like ledger will not work.
*  When setting up the environment variables for the `HYPERLIQUID_ADDRESS` and `HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY`, you must use ones from a Hot wallet (e.g. generated with Rabby, Metamask, ...). Your `HYPERLIQUID_ADDRESS` is your Ethereum wallet addrees (copy/paste from Metamask or Rabby), and `HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY` is the secret key given by Hyperliquid when you generate a API key pair (On Hyperliquid website, section more->API).

## Configuration

The bot uses a combination of configuration files and environment variables:

### 1. **Configuration File** (config.json) - Primary Configuration

The preferred way to configure the bot is through the `config.json` file, which controls most of the bot's behavior:

```json
{
  "general": {
    "debug": false,
    "tracked_coins": ["BTC", "ETH", "HYPE", "SOL", "USDC", "PUMP", "PURR", "FARTCOIN"],
    "autostart": true
  },
  "allocation": {
    "spot_pct": 70,
    "perp_pct": 30,
    "rebalance_threshold": 0.05,
    "leverage": 3
  },
  "trading": {
    "refresh_interval_sec": 60
  },
  "api": {
    "host": "0.0.0.0",
    "port": 8080,
    "enabled": true
  }
} 
```

Configuration sections:
- **General settings:**
  - `debug`: Enable detailed debug logging
  - `tracked_coins`: List of coins to track and trade
  - `autostart`: Whether to start trading automatically
- **Allocation settings:**
  - `spot_pct`: Percentage of capital to allocate to spot positions (e.g., 70%)
  - `perp_pct`: Percentage of capital to allocate to perpetual positions (e.g., 30%)
  - `rebalance_threshold`: Funding APR value threshold for changing the position (e.g., 0.05 = 5% if APR funding is less that 5%, stop and try to open another, better, one on another coin)
  - `leverage` : leverage used
- **Trading settings:**
  - `refresh_interval_sec`: Interval for checking for refreshing positions in seconds
- **API settings:**
  - `host`: Host for the API server
  - `port`: Port for the API server
  - `enabled`: Whether the API server is enabled

### 2. **Environment Variables** - Required for Authentication

These environment variables are used for authentication with HyperLiquid and must be set:

- `HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your private key for trading on HyperLiquid
- `HYPERLIQUID_ADDRESS`: Your Ethereum address for HyperLiquid

Example using environment variables:
```bash
export HYPERLIQUID_PRIVATE_KEY={PRIVATE_KEY}
export HYPERLIQUID_ADDRESS={SUB_ACCOUNT_TRADING_ADDRESS}
```

On windows, add it in the Windows dedicated setting.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Set up environment variables for authentication
3. Customize `config.json` to match your desired trading parameters
4. Run the example script to test your configuration:
```bash
python example.py
```
5. Start the bot:
```bash
python Delta.py
```

## Building

Build the Docker image with:

```bash
./build.sh
```

This will create two images:
- `hypervault-tradingbot:delta` (latest version)
- `hypervault-tradingbot:delta-1.0.0` (versioned tag)
